Now the problem of the day, it is easy, do not worry


Write a function that takes an array as argument, and returns **true** or **false** depending on the following

Returns **true** if the first half of the array is containing the same elements present in the last half, and **false** if it does not

If the array contains **odd** number elements ,the function returns true if the two parts around the middle element contain the same elements

**Elements in the two parts are not necessary to be in the same order**

**For example**
```
check([1,4,6,8,8,6,1,4]); // true
check(["a","b","d","g","f","b","g","d","a"])  // true
check(["a","b","d","g","f","b","g","f","a"]);// false
check([10,20,30,40,10,20,50])  // false
```
Good luck guys
