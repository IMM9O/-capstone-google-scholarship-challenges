A matrix of two-dimensional **(N*N)** of integers. What you have to do is change the positions of the elements above and bellow of the main diagonal of the matrix:

**Name of the function:** transpose(mat) { }

Example:
Parameter:

    1  2  3  4
    5  6  7  8
    9  10 11 12
    13 14 15 16

Also all the elements in the main diagonal must be change to **1**. Like in the bellow example.
**Output must be in a string format. Leave two space as separator between each number:**

    1  5  9  13
    2  1  10 14
    3  7  1  15
    4  8  12 1

    transpose([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]);

**TIPS:**
In this course we didn’t work with **Matrix**. To work with matrix you should use two dimentions, for instance:
**console.log(mat[3][2])**; // This will print the value **15**. This number is in the raw **3** and column **2**.

The **first** position of a Matrix is the index **zero** like a normal array. So if you want to print the value **1** you should write **console.log(mat[0][0]);**

_**Don’t return the matrix.Print the values in the mentioned format**_

**If all of you are agree I suggest for tomorrow a typical University exercice the matrix inverse. I know this exercice is not easy because you have to understand the method and then write your code and is more difficult than all exercices we have done in this course.**

**But is a great exercice. If you do it feel proud of yourself.**

**Difficulty of this exercise maybe medium level. So if all of you are agree and want to do the exercice we can use the rest of days before start the new udacity course.**

**I suggest do this exercice from tomorrow 13 until 15.**
