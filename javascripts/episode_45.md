The problem of the day|(Codewars one) :grinning:

Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns one array represent shuffled numbers from both arrays, all numbers should be in the same order in their original one.

**For example** 
```
shuffle([10,30],[20,40]) // [10,20,30,40]
shuffle([1,5,2,4],[6,2,8,3]); // [1,6,5,2,2,8,4,3]
```

Note: all numbers are integers and the two arrays may have different lengths.

Good luck guys :grinning:
