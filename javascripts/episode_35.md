The problem of the day, not hard  :grinning:

Write a function that takes an **object** with alphabetical letter or numerical keys  as argument , the function should sort the keys but still every key should point to the same value after sorting

**For example**
```
sortOb({d:"John", t:"Mark", a:"Antony"}) // {a:"Antony",d:"John",t:"Mark"}
sortOb({3:"Go to work",1:"wake up", 2:"Breakfast"}) // {1:"Wake up", 2:"Breakfast",3:"Go to work"}
```

Good luck guys :grinning:
