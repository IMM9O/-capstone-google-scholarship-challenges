Now the problem of the day
Write a function that takes a **string** as an argument and returns the **most repeated character** in this string(just one), if most repeated characters are more than one(repeated by the same number) return **null**

**For example**
```
mostRepeated("hello")  // l
mostRepeated("Hi javaScript masters"); // a
mostRepeated("Udacity");  // null
```

Good luck
