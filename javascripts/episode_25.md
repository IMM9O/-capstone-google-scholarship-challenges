Now the problem of the day :thinking:

<h2>Shift To Next</h2>

Write a function that takes a **string** as argument and returns a **string** after following modification

Getting the **first letter** in the string, then searching all words in string containing this letter, if it is present in a word, shift it to the **next word** in the **same index** of it in the original one, if the next word index that should the letter shifted to is not existed , skip it


**For example**
```
shiftToNext("Every day a problem "); // very Eday a problem
shiftToNext("hello i will be there in one hour!!");// ello hi will be tere ihn one hour!!
shiftToNext("paul knows how to keep a cat!!");//aul pknows how to keep a cat!!
```
Good luck guys :grinning:
