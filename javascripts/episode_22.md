The problem of the day 22 :grinning: , it is really too easy :grinning:

Write a function that takes a **string as an argument** and returns a **string** represents **pairing** of every letter of the original string with the **second next  letter in alphabetical system**, if one letter in the original string is **y or Y,z or Z** , the letter that should be added would be **a or A**,**b or B** respectively

**For example**
```
secNextChar("aft"); // acfhtv
secNextChar("XyZ") // XZyaZB
```

Good luck guys :grinning:
