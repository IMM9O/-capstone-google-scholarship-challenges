Now the problem of the day :grinning:

## Incomplete sum

Write a function that takes an **array of numbers** as argument and return the **sum** of the largest and smallest numbers and all numbers in between **except** other numbers found in the array

**For example**
```
incompleteSum([2,3,5])   // 11
incompleteSum([3,6,2,1,4]); // 12
incompleteSum([1,3,5,10]); //47

```
