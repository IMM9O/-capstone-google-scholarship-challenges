The problem of the day|(Codewars one) :grinning:

<h2>Chess Board</h2>

Write a function that takes a **number** as argument and returns a **string**

The number represents the size  of a chess board we need to draw, for example if the number is **8** we need to create grid  of size **8 * 8**

When the number is 8, printing the string resulted should exactly produce something exactly like this:

**For Example**
```
makeGrid(8);//
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
```

Good luck guys :grinning:
