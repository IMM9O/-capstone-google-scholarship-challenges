Now, the problem of the day :grinning:
## How Much Repeated

Write a function that takes a **string** as an argument and returns a **number** represents the **frequency of most repeated word** in the string, if no one repeated return 1.

**For example**
```
numRepeated("thank you, many thanks") // 1
numRepeated("thank you, thank you again"); // 2
```

Good luck guys :grinning:
