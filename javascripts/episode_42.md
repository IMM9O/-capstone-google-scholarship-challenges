The problem of the day|(Codewars one) :grinning:
Write a function that takes an **array of  numbers** as argument and returns a **string** of  alphabetical letters every alphabetical letter should be chosen by this pattern.

From 1-26 **a-z**
Less than 1 **a**
More than 26 **z**

Every number in input should represent the **alphabetical position** of the letter in alphabetical system, if the number is less than 1 the letter is **a** , if bigger than 26 the letter should be **z**.


**For example** 
```
numToAlphabet([0,1,2,3,4]);//aabcd
numToAlphabet([13,100,25,20,-1])//mzyta
```

Good luck guys :grinning:
