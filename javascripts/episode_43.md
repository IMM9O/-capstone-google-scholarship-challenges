The problem of the day|(Codewars one) :grinning:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument and returns a number represents how many numbers should be added to the array to be consecutive array

**For example**
```
makeConsecutive([1,3,4,5]) // 1 as 2 should be added
makeConsecutive([10,12,14]) // 2 as 11 and 13 should be added
makeConsecutive([9,3,6,8])// 3 as 4,5,7 should be added
```

Good luck guys :grinning:
