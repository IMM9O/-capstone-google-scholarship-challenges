Now the problem of the day, sorry for the tough one yesterday :grinning:
lets reconcile :grinning:

Write a function that takes **two arguments** the first represents an **array of numbers**  and the second is a **number**, if sum of two elements in array is equal to the the number(the second argument), remove the two elements and replace them by the sum.

**For example**

```
reduce([1,2,3],3); // [3,3]
reduce([8,12,16,20,4],20) // [20,20,20] // sum inserted in place of the number of the first index
reduce([14,8,6,8,3,5],16) // [14,16,6,3,5]
reduce([1,6,9,8],25);  // return the array [1,6,9,8] as no sum
```
Good luck guys :grinning:
