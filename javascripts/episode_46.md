arrayDictionary = ["and  ", "   such ", "want", "learn", "Angular.jsss" , "   Portugal  ", " my ", " live", "in ", "React.jsss", " udacity", "house", "  go   ", "a", "course"];

arrayPhrases = ["  I want to learn  JavaScript frameworks such as Angular.js   and   React.js   ", " I live in portugal in my house ", "  I want    to go england   and I  have a house in Portugal ", " I have  learned a  lot   in uDacity     course   ."];

array arrayOutput = ["[I] Want [To] Learn [JavaScript] [Frameworks] Such [As] [Angular.js] And [React.js]", "[I] Live In [Portugal] In My House", "[I] Want [To] Go [England] And [I] [Have] A House In Portugal", "[I] [Have] [Learned] A [Lot] In [UDACITY] Course [.]"];

**Please note:** This words are not equals **Portugal** and **portugal** because the first letter is in uppercase and the other one in lowercase.

_**Explanation:**_

_**create a function with this name: searchWords(arrayDictionary, arrayPhrases){}**_

What you have to do is search all words in the arrayDictionary if the word is not in the dictionary you must put the word inside [] as in the given example.

the arrayDictionary can have several blank spaces at the beginning and at the end.
The arrayPhrases can also have several blank spaces at the beginning and at the end and also can have several blank spaces between words

The output: each word in the output can have only one blank space as separator and can not have blank spaces at the beginning and at the end.
Also only each first character of each word from the output must be in uppercase and if you find the word **udacity** your must convert this word to uppercase all characters of the word udacity like in the given example.
