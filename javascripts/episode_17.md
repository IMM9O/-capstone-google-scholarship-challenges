Hi again dear learners

Now the problem of the day, it should be a Reconciliation, sorry for yesterday problem

## Remove All Copies

Write a function that **remove all repeated elements** in array represents the argument of the function, the remaining elements should be in the **same order** as original one.

**For example**
```
removeCopies([5,8,4,8,3,2,1,5]); // [4,3,2,1]
removeCopies([1,6,"a",6,"b",7,8,"a",1]); // ["b",7,8]
```
Good luck guys
