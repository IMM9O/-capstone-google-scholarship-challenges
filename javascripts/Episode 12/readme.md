Now the problem of the day, Ready??

## A big random number

Write a function that takes an array of two elements (numbers < 10) as argument, and returns a **number** composed of all the numbers between the two numbers with minimum and maximum numbers inclusives  **randomly** every time you call the function,  numbers that composes our returned number should be **different**( no repeated numbers)  and number of these numbers should be the **same** with the numbers in all range between the maximum and minimum number in array, with minimum and maximum **inclusive**, the array is **not sorted** so no strict places for  maximum or minimum number in it

Really i have wrote tons of word "number" so it may be confusing, lets jump to examples

**for example**

```
randomNum([1,5]);  // 45132
randomNum([5,1]);  // 31452
randomNum([0,9]); // 7429850136
randomNum([0,9])  // 5682910347
```

Good luck guys
