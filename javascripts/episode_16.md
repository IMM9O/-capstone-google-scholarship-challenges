Now the problem of the day :grinning:

## Shift Capital

Write a function that takes **two arguments**, one represents a **string** that contains a **capital letter** that can be anywhere in the string , the second argument is a **number** represent number of shifts of the capital letter in the string when the function is called, if the index that the capital letter should be shifted to is not present , continue shifting from the beginning :sunglasses:

**For example**

```
shiftCapital(Udacity,4) // daciUty
shiftCapital(leaRning,4) // Rleaning
shiftCapital(frienDs,6) // frienDs
shiftCapital(frienDs,3)  // frDiens
```

Good luck
