The problem of the day|(Codewars one) :grinning:

Write a function that takes a string as argument and returns true or false depending on the following

true: if the string is a valid word
false: if the string is not valid word

the function should return true with “abcdabcd” because all characters has same occurence this is the same with the string “abcd” so they are both valid words

and it should return false with this string “abcdab” because a and b are repeated twice while the rest of characters are not so it is not a valid word

Good luck guys :grinning:
