# Episode 13

Now the problem of the day

**The unique string**

Write a function that can take two or **more** strings as arguments and returns a string represent them all , all characters should be in same order in the original string but **no duplication** in the returned string

**For example**

```
uniqueStr("abcd","ahkd") // abcdhk
uniqueStr("rbanr","fzyrc") // rbanfzyc
uniqueStr("every","day","a problem") // evrydapoblm
```

**Note**: of Course you know that E and e are different characters

**Please** guys

* Write **few tips** beside your solution explaining it, take in in your consideration silent fellows that try to learn without participating.
* It is **not mandatory** to share your code that works, please if you are stuck share your one that does not work and we will try to help you find where the problem.
* Fellows who just watch and learn **silently**, do not hesitate to ask about anything confusing or even share your try, this is the best way to learn.

Good luck guys
