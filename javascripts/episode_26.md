Hi JavaScript masters!!! :slightly_smiling_face:, here we are again

Now the problem of the day :grinning:, it is easier than yesterday one so do not worry :sweat_smile:

Write a function that takes **two arrays of numbers** as arguments and returns only **one array** represents all the numbers that are **not common** between the two arrays **excluding** the numbers that is divisible by any number that is common between the two arrays(> 1)

note, no repeated element in the final array and the elements should be in the same order in their original arrays


**For example**
```
filter([1,2,3],[1,2,4]); // [3] as 4 is divisible by 2( the common number)
filter([1,6,2,5,5,8,3,7,8],[2,6,4,4,9,1]) // [5, 3, 7, 9]
```

the numbers that are not common between the two arrays are `5,5,8,3,7,8,4,4,9`  but 8  and 4 are  divisible by 2 which is a common number  so they are excluded and the result would be [5,3,7,9]

 i hope it is clear enough :slightly_smiling_face:

Good luck guys :grinning:
